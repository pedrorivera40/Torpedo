    AStar search class.

    This class implements the A* algorithm for the path-finding problem.
    Its optimization function F(node) is based on a time-based heuristic
    value that denotes the estimated time from the current node to the 
    goal state. The time from start value for a successor node is 
    assigned based on the path cost (time) from source to current node,
    and the path cost from current to successor based on speed limit,
    distance between the two nodes, and traffic delay between these nodes.
